# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Analysis using the Kickstarter dataset

### Purpose
Visualizing campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals; analysis created to understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Project created to help Louise with the launching of her play Fever. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
A third of the projects came out between April and July (33%) and May & June seem to be the months that have the most successful outcomes. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I would advise Louise to take a look at the spreadsheet, and not to base her next move on the chart, as it is clear that there are way less data to make conclusions above the $25,000 set goal. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
It took me some time to be able to apply the COUNTIFS function. Once understood, it was easier to use. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The second trimester has the most successful outcomes
2. The third trimester has the most canceled projects

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Most projects have a goal under $10,000 and those are the most likely to be successful. It is harder to make a conclusion for for a few projects whose goals were above $25,000 as there are just a few to draw a conclusion from. Seeing that 67% of projects whose goals ranged between $35,000 and $44,999 might be misleading as there are just 9 projects analyzed in that range. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

There are not that many projects whose goals are above $15,000, making it hard to draw conclusions from it. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could review how successful projects are depending on the country as well as on the parent category, or on the percentage funded is linked to the outcome of a project.
